## About
I'm currently studying design patterns in Rust using the course available at https://www.linkedin.com/learning/design-patterns-for-rust. `Tim` has done an excellent job providing an intuitive course on Design Patterns in Rust. I'm rewriting and consolidating my knowledge from the course, aiming to gain a deeper understanding of its concepts. This resource is highly recommended for those looking to grasp design patterns in Rust at a beginner or intermediate level. Expect more advanced insights to be shared in the future
